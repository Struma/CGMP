Layers that are needed to make a functional map

1. Structures - concrete, wood, brick, stone, ect.. that captures the human structure of the environment like roads/buildings/cement foundations.
2. Beds - Bushbeds, Woodybeds, flower beds, garden beds, ect...
3. Bounds - boundaries and fences
4. Utilities - Water, electricity, internet, AC, ect...
5. Vegetation - Plants and trees
6. Paths - footpaths and bike paths
7. Features - unique point features


Each layer is to have it's own XML symbology style and database fields so that others may make maps without having to fiddle.
Those resources will be made available in the "shared resources" plugin in QGIS.
