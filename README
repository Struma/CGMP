# The Community Garden Mapping Project
### Tallahassee Chapter


#### About
The CGMP works to map community gardens engaged in food production in service of the community. This project was created after noticing that there are many gardens in TLH and that they are mostly untracked cultural features. The CMGP provides maps and databases that connect these gardens and the people that work between them.

#### Resources and Standards

The CGMP project makes maps and standards with free resources to help others to create standardized maps for gardens in their communities. 

Standards, graphics, symbology, and other technical information will be posted >here< once they become available.
